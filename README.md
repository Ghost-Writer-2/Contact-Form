## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS animation
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned
I got to learn the basics of CSS animations. I practiced more on using media queries and I also got to practice form validation using vanilla javascript. I also got the practice everything I learned about JavaScript function closures. I'm also in the process of learning BEM and SASS. 

### Continued development
I want to continue learning more advanced CSS techniques and also improve on creating responsive layout and writing clean, readable code.
